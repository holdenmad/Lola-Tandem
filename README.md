## Description

Lola is a language tandem finder that brings people together to learn languages. During the time we made this app, we both were students at the WBS Coding School, and created the basis of the project within a 3-week time period while on campus, and will continue to finish it over time. We're excited to share our accomplishments with you, and perhaps inspire you to learn a new language.
